Implementation-of-a-Nanoprocessor
=================================

This project was done as a part of the Computer Architecture module I followed at University of Moratuwa.
The project was designed in schematics using XIlinx ISE Design Suite. 
This can be implemented in a BASYS 2 FPGA board. 
The nanoprocessor is capable of performing four different instructions. 
A program to calculate the sum of integers up to 3 has been hard coded to a ROM as a test. 
Each instruction is fed into the nanoprocessor at each clock pulse. 
A test bench file for simulation is also included.
